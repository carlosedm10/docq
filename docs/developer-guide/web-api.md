# Web API (alpha)

We have a web API, which is used by the Chrome Extension. But the API is still too unstable for prime time and the DX isn't great yet so we are holding back from publishing it.

But if you do have a use case we'd love to chat. [Join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/docqai/shared_invite/zt-27p17lu6v-6KLJxSmt61vfNqCavSE73A), jump on Twitter @docqai, or email <hi@docqai.com> to discuss with our founders.
